# Database  for React App

This project serves as the database for a React application. It provides APIs and handles server-side logic necessary for the application to function properly.

## Setup

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: First, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will install all necessary Node.js packages required for the backend.

2. **Install Express and CORS**: Additionally, make sure to install Express and CORS using the following commands:

    ```bash
    npm install express
    npm install cors
    ```

    Express is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, while CORS is a middleware that enables cross-origin resource sharing.

3. **Run the Server**: Once dependencies are installed, start the server by running:

    ```bash
     node app.js
    ```

    This command will launch the server, and it will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you have access to the following scripts:

- `npm install`: Installs all required dependencies for the backend.
- `npm install express`: Installs the Express framework for Node.js.
- `npm install cors`: Installs the CORS middleware for enabling cross-origin resource sharing.
- `node app.js`: Starts the server in development mode.

## Logs

During the runtime of the server, logs will be displayed in the terminal. These logs provide information about the server's operations and any errors encountered.
